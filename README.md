Demo can be run against a *known endpoint* or a *local server*.  
Configuration of the endpoint's URL can be done in `Sources/Demo/main.swift`.

To run the demo with a local server, please follow these steps:  

1. get the VSS data server from [GENIVI/vss-graphql](https://github.com/GENIVI/vss-graphql)
2. follow a _setup_ to run the VSS data server locally
3. open `VSSGraphQL.xcodeproj` 
4. choose `Demo` as the target from top left and run it

Configuration of the demo's requested values can be done in `Sources/Demo/main.swift`.
